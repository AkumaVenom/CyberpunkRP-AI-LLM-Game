========================================================================

CyberpunkRP is a cutting-edge game powered by 100% Local AI LLM NPCs for every character in the game.

CyberpunkRP is a immersive roleplaying experience where every NPC is powered by local, real-time AI‚Äînot scripted. There are no canned dialogue trees, no predictable responses. Every character in the game is a living, thinking digital mind driven by cutting-edge LLM (Large Language Model) technology, running entirely on your own hardware.

Talk. Listen. React.
Using built-in voice recognition and TTS, you have real conversations with AI citizens of Neon City. They respond with their own unique voices, emotions, and thoughts in real time, shaped by who they are and how the world around them evolves.
From lively party clubs to shady underworld fixers and cyborg hackers to weary street vendors, The city breathes through its people.

Set in a sprawling cyberpunk slum metropolis where the night never ends, Neon City pulses with energy as music echoes from every corner, night clubs illuminate the streets, and towering skyscrapers cast a glowing haze over the urban jungle, As the city hums with life.
CyberpunkRP isn‚Äôt just a game. It‚Äôs a living simulation of a cyberpunk world where the people are as real as the city they live in.
Welcome to Neon City. The lights are on. The AI are awake.
